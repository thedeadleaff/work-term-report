            <h2>Work Term 2 | W22</h2>
            <p> Scotiabank - Fraud Management<br><br>
                Cybersecurity, criminal investigations and law have always peaked my interest. In this role I was able to work with data
                for real world, real time cases which required an eye for detail, good communication skills, and creativity. I used a
                variety of tools throughout my work term, but also utilized the downtime in my schedule to expand my technical learning.
                Python, Web Design, PowerShell and a look into microcomputing were all tapped into and have helped me through this role, and in my learning and growth overall.
            </p>

            <h5>Goals</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                Throughout this work term, I had main goals that spanned outside of this role. With this, it was difficult to dial in, and curate 
                a path I wished to take despite my habit of always looking too far ahead.
            </p>
            <br><ul class="mt-overflow-auto">
                <li>I wish to be able to manage my work well and delivery quality solutions for tasks</li>
                <li>I wish to be able to gain insight on work with the resources availible without feeling the stress of reading for prolonged periods of time</li>
                <li>To integrate as much detail into my work; enrich the experience of readers who will be working with documents I will be assisting in completing</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>
                My above goals were not only met, but the learning that I have gained has helped direct my in a path that will best suit my strengths,
                and offer chances for me to improve on my weaknesses.

                Goal number 1, a creative thinking goal, was set to ensure that I was able to identify if I was falling short, and how I can gain knowledge
                to help me complete tasks with great detail and efficiency. I used my creativity, and gathered as much information as I could to offer as much context
                possible for other employees on teams, and readers after my work term was completed. I read documentation, manuals and Scotia's main fraud page to
                ensure I was meeting all crietia and working as a reliable team member.

                Goal 2, reading comprehension, was not only a challenge for the work term, but for myself as a person. I am able to recite long articles of text,
                and understand various reading voices, tones and vocabulary. But despite being able to comprehend writing, why would this be a goal at all? The effort of
                focus required to remain engaged and have a working memory of what was just explained is why this goal is a challenge. By having ADHD, reading for prolonged
                periods of time can get stressful quickly. I took action by splitting each task by catogory and read based on each category. This allowed me the
                opportunity to alternate between tasks before feeling drained, and also helped me connect ideas across tasks -  helping my creativity and understanding.
                All in all, I was able to complete tedious tasks that required lots of reading in a way that not only meant success for the outcome, but also success
                for my own mental state and endurance.

                This last goal, Goal 3, under technological literacy, adds onto goal 2 in that the work that comes out of my learned skills will benefit the teams the schedule
                gets busier and busier. A single document was created by my 2 coworkers and I to help new interns and Fraud employees get a grasp of the vast amount of information
                requried to complete work. This organization of details also helped me along the way with analyzing data and presenting ideas to stakeholders. As well as this,
                 utilizing my preexisting skills helped me complete work at a fast pace, and this also helped the team stay on track of their busy schedules.

                    Andrew Mohabir, Scotiabank Fraud Manager, has been working as a manager since May 2019. He is involved in one of the most important changes internally for fraud as well
                    (since Scotiabank is... indeed a bank, I'm not sure how many details I can reveal!). While working on his team, and on other tasks and projects, I was able to
                    also interact and work with Aleem Samji - Contractor and Senior Analyst, Sharmilla Sarwan - Fraud Senior Manager and Deodatt (Deo) Persaud - Integration and Payment Manager.
                    
                    Deo specifically, in a coffee chat, walked me through his journey starting out as a business student at Ryerson to working in IT and management. I've learned that a lab
                    environment would best suit me from this chat, and that the learning and discovery from one path can also translate onto a variety of other jobs as well, even unrealted.
                    Below is an image of Deo, brought to you by LinkedIn.
